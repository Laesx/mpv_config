# mpv_config
My Personal MPV Config

To use this config create a directory named "mpv" in Roaming and run this command inside (make sure the folder is empty):

`git clone https://github.com/Laesx/mpv_config.git .`

The paths for screenshots and for the clip script are in: mpv.conf and then in script-opts/webm.conf
